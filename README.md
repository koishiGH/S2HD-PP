# S2HD++ - a w.i.p. port of Sonic 2 HD to C++.

* I have no idea how far I'll get with this but I at least wanna get the title screen/main menu working.

* You WILL need the extracted files from the original sonicorca.dat file. You can get them from [my repo](https://github.com/2HDModding/sonicorca_unpacked), or you can extract them yourself via [OrcaTools](https://github.com/2HDModding/OrcaTools)

# Small Disclaimer

* I have no affiliation with SEGA OR Team S2HD, I'm just a fan doing fan things!

* I won't be working on this as much due to being busy with other projects, but if anyone wants to help on this just make a fork and pr your changes!
